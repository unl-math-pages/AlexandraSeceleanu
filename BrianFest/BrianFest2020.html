<h2>Parking Information</h2>

A campus parking map can be found <a href="https://parking.unl.edu/maps/CityCampusParking.pdf">here.</a><br>


<br><br>


</center>

<b>Saturday:</b>



<UL>
<li>If you are staying at the Graduate Hotel and arrive early enough you can park your car in the Graduate hotel parking garage. (The cost will be added to your hotel bill and direct-billed to the Department.)  It is then a 10-15 minute walk to Burnett Hall.
<li>For on campus parking, there are some 50 metered parking stalls located in the parking lot west of Avery Hall and south of the stadium. (The lot is labelled F4/D2 on the campus map.) The meters are free after 12pm on Saturday and all day on Sunday.
However, these stalls tend to fill up quickly.
<li>Another on campus option is to park in the Stadium Drive parking garage just west of the stadium and the metered lot mentioned above.  The cost is hourly ($1 per hour, I think) with a maximum of $7 per day.
</UL>

<br>

<b>Sunday:</b>

<UL>
<li>If you are staying at the Graduate, you can leave your car in the hotel parking garage (even if you check out) and walk to Burnett Hall.
<li>You can park in the metered spots in the lot west of Avery (free all day). You can also park in the metered spots on Stadium Drive, which are also free on Sunday.
